            <p>Hey there! I'm Atomixal, I'm an 18 year old from the UK and I like music, learning new things and programming</p>
            <p>I've made this website to learn the basics of how to code, I know I'm still pretty bad at it, but I hope to get better with time</p>
            <p>I've made a few things, you can check out most of them on my github.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I might write about my favourite games/music/anything else in the future. We'll see I guess</p>
            <p>Thank you for checking out my website though, I've enjoyed the whole process of making it, and would like to learn how to make it have cool animations and stuff in the future</p>
            <p>If you want to talk to me, add me on discord! @atomixal</p>
